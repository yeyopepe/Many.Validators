# Many.Validators
A set of very-easy-to-read immutable types to add seamless validations in your projects.

I focused on:
- Less documentation, better code legibility.
- No extra line of code.
- [Extremely] easy integration.
- Minimum overhead compared to traditional copy-pasted-conditionals way or any other implementation.

- New Half type support for NET5 and NET6 projects.

 <sub>(*) This column shows the average overhead calculation in the validation-passes scenario that is the most expensive: we need to perform a validation and it passes. **This is a measure of the overhead cost, not the cost itself.**
<br/>The baseline corresponds to the simplest way to validate each case (copy-pasted IF conditional(s) and manual exception throwing). Data is provided from supported frameworks but in this table the value is from NET60 benchmarks.
<br>Results for older frameworks can vary depending the framework (generally older the framework a bit worse the result) and if you force conversions or not (you can check the complete results at Many.Validators.Benchmark/Data).</sub>

### Two-way conversion between validator and underlying types
```
NotNull<string> notMullStringValidator = "whatever"; //Ok
string x = notMullStringValidator; //Ok

notMullStringValidator.Equals(x); //true!
```

### Seamless integration
Use validators in your methods referring your underlying type:
```
bool WhateverMethod(NotNull<string> @param)
{
    //@param is observed and validated when is instantiated. 
    //If validation fails no line of code will be run in this method

    Console.WriteLine("Whatever");
    
    //Gets @param value with no conversion
    return !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(@param); 
}
```
<br/>
And call your methods as usual with no additional conversions:

```
string p;

<Code where you can assign a value to p or not...>

var result = WhateverMethod(p);

<Continues if no exception was raised...>

```
